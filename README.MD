# Project Name: Interactive Form
## Project description 
  We will be given a a form. Our objective is to add customized, conditional behavior and interactivity and validate user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

## Skills used:
- Basic to advanced DOM manipulation.
- Jquery.
- Create Element.
- Element properties.
- Append Child.
- Remove Child.
- Insert elements into the DOM.
- Real time Validation.
- Event listeners.
 
## Exceeds Expectations:
  To exceed the expectations we had to hide the "Color" label and select menu until a T-Shirt design is selected from the "Design" menu, program at least one of your error messages so that more information is provided depending on the error (I did credit card) and program your form so that it provides a real-time validation error message for at least one text input field (I did all the required inputs).
